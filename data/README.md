This directory lists the updated data (district names) from PMGSY portal.

The district names are mapped to the ones in map files (topojson) from [covid19india](https://github.com/covid19india/covid19india-react/tree/master/public/maps).

Read more on the naming conventions at https://github.com/bkamapantula/pmgsy#district-naming-convention.
